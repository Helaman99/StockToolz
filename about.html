            <p>
                My name is Alan, and I'm the creator of this site!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a computer science major at Eastern Washington
                University, and I have a real passion for trading
                in the stock market. I do mostly swing and day trades,
                and have been since early 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, I noticed I was making a LOT of calculations
                manually <i>every</i> time I traded. So I decided to
                build some tools to do the redundant calculations for
                me so I could focus more on the markets.
            </p>
            <p>
                But as an entrepreneur I also understand the potential
                value of creating websites and monetising them, which
                is why I decided to make my tools public and usable by
                anyone! So if you wouldn't mind spreading the word about
                these tools to all the savvy traders you know, I would
                be very grateful!
            </p>
            <p>
                Happy trading!
            </p>
